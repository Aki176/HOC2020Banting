<center>üè∞ DanMachi Tower Defense Game for Hour Of Code 2020 at Banting SS</center>


## How to play
1. You need Python 3.x
2. Open console, run "pip install pygame"
3. Run the game and enjoy.

## What does this game has?
Simple function like a normal TD game. 3 Levels, 3 Types of enemies, 3 Types of heroes (turret).

The code is well commented so you can change or alter anything to fit your need.

I don't have much time to make more level, the same as enemy so that's why there is only 3 for now.
